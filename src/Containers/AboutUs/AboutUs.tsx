                This page is created by 20 years old experienced horror movie enjoyer.
                Since there's a shit tone of ass horror movies my main goal is to provide people with dope horror movie recommendations and keep them tuned about upcoming movie premieres.
                <br/><br/>
                But if you like to watch gore and disgusting stuff like "Serbian Film" please leave this page because you won't find anything that pleases your twisted taste and please seek professional help ;)
            </p>

            <p className="fs-5 fw-bold text-secondary">I'm also an aspiring front-end developer, so please check out some of my works on the Portfolio page  ^~^</p>
